            <h2>Social Behavior</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Pack Mentality: Dogs are pack animals by nature, and they generally enjoy the company of other dogs
                    and
                    humans. They often look for leadership and structure, which is why it's important for owners to set
                    clear
                    boundaries and rules.</li>
                <li>Affection: Dogs can be incredibly affectionate and will seek out human contact for petting,
                    cuddling,
                    and companionship. Many dogs will show affection by wagging their tails, licking their owner's face,
                    or
                    cuddling up next to them.</li>
                <li>Separation Anxiety: Dogs can become very attached to their owners, and some may experience
                    separation
                    anxiety when left alone. This can lead to destructive behaviors like chewing, excessive barking, or
                    inappropriate elimination.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Stress and Fear-Based Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fear of Loud Noises: Many dogs are afraid of loud noises like thunderstorms, fireworks, or even
                    vacuum cleaners. They might hide, cower, or become agitated when exposed to these stimuli.</li>

                <li>Avoidance Behavior: When a dog feels threatened or stressed, it may exhibit avoidance behavior, like
                    backing away, hiding, or attempting to escape the situation. Understanding these signals helps to
                    prevent further stress.</li>
                <li>Aggression: Aggression can occur in response to fear, territoriality, or frustration. Aggressive
                    dogs may display growling, baring teeth, or lunging. It’s essential to understand the cause of
                    aggression and address it with the help of a professional dog trainer or behaviorist if necessary.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Barking: Barking is one of the most common ways dogs communicate. They bark to express excitement,
                    alert
                    their owners to something happening, or when they are anxious. Understanding the context of barking
                    can help
                    determine the cause.</li>
                <li>Tail Wagging: A wagging tail generally signifies excitement or happiness, but the speed and manner
                    of
                    the wag can indicate different emotions. A fast wagging tail with stiff posture might signal
                    agitation,
                    while a relaxed, slow wag suggests contentment.</li>
                <li>Whining and Whimpering: Dogs may whine or whimper when they are anxious, uncomfortable, or want
                    attention. This can also be a sign that a dog needs something, such as food, water, or to go
                    outside.</li>

            <h2>Play Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Play Bow: One of the most common play behaviors is the "play bow," where the dog lowers its front
                    end while
                    keeping its rear end up. This behavior is a signal that the dog wants to play.</li>
                <li>Chasing: Many dogs have a strong prey drive and will enjoy activities like chasing balls, frisbees,
                    or
                    even small animals. It’s important to provide them with outlets for this natural behavior.</li>
                <li>Chewing: Chewing is a natural and important behavior for dogs. Puppies chew to relieve the
                    discomfort of
                    teething, while adult dogs may chew to relieve boredom, stress, or anxiety. Providing proper chew
                    toys helps
                    prevent destructive behavior.</li>
            </ul>

        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Health-Related Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lethargy or Decreased Activity: A sudden decrease in activity or interest in food and play can be a
                    sign that something is wrong. It’s essential to monitor your dog’s behavior and seek veterinary
                    advice if any changes in energy or appetite occur.</li>
                <li>Excessive Scratching or Grooming: If a dog is scratching excessively or licking a certain area, it
                    could indicate allergies, fleas, or other skin issues. It's essential to address any health concerns
                    that might be causing discomfort.</li>

            <h2>Training and Learning Behavior</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Obedience: With proper training, dogs can learn to follow commands like "sit," "stay," "come," and
                    "heel."
                    Positive reinforcement methods (treats, praise) are effective for encouraging desired behaviors.
                </li>
                <li>Puppy Behavior: Puppies are curious and tend to explore everything. They can be a bit more
                    energetic,
                    and housetraining is an important part of puppy development. Patience is key when training a puppy.
                </li>
                <li>Learning by Association: Dogs are able to learn by association, meaning they can connect specific
                    actions with rewards or consequences. This principle is the foundation of many training techniques,
                    like
                    crate training or teaching commands.</li>

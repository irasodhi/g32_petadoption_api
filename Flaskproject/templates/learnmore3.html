            250,000 adoptable pets, to bringing your pet home, to living a long and happy life with your new family

            The following links will take you to some of the most frequently asked questions about adopting a pet that

            with any additional questions you have.</p>

        <div class="o"><h2>How Do I Search For a Pet?</h2></div>
        <p>Petfinder.com is a searchable list of pets from over 11,000 shelters and rescue groups across the US, Canada,
            and Mexico. To find an adoptable pet, you can begin your search using “Find a Pet” located above. Since
            Petfinder is updated regularly, we recommend that you keep checking back or create a saved search email
            alert to be notified when new pets matching your search criteria are added to the site</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Can I Save My Search or Be Notified When New Pets Are Available?
                To be notified by email when pets matching your search criteria are first posted on the site, use our
                saved search feature. After performing a search, you will see a button with a bell icon to the right of
                your search results. Click on this button to set an email alert for your search. To manage all saved
                searches you can login or create and account</li>
            <li>Is the Pet I See on Petfinder Still Adoptable?
                Across the 11,000 shelter and rescue groups in Petfinder’s North American network, each is responsible
                for updating adoptable pet listings. To learn about a specific pet, please contact the shelter or rescue
                directly by going to the Pet Profile page and clicking the “Ask About” button.</li>
            <li>How Often is Petfinder Updated?

                Because each shelter and rescue group is responsible for keeping its adoptable pet listings current,
                Petfinder is continuously updated.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="o"><h2>How Do I Adopt a Pet I See On fluffytails?</h2></div>
        <p>Petfinder is a website and searchable database for over 11,000 animal shelters and rescue groups across the
            US, Canada and Mexico to post their adoptable pets. While Petfinder does provide a web-based adoption
            platform for groups across North America, we are not involved in any of our members’ pet adoptions. Each
            adoption group using our site has its own adoption policies and procedures and solely handles its own pet
            adoptions. To adopt a pet you see listed on Petfinder, please click the “Ask About” button on the pet’s
            profile. You will then be given the group’s contact information and, if an email is available for that
            group, you will be able to email that group using our form.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How Do I Meet a Pet I See on fluffytail?
                Once you find a pet you’re interested in adopting, you’ll probably want to meet him or her. Go to the
                Pet Profile page by clicking on the pet’s picture or name on a search results page. This takes you to
                the pet’s detail page. Click “Ask About” to directly contact the shelter or rescue to inquire further.
            </li>
            <li>Does Contacting the Shelter or Rescue Group Reserve the Pet I’m Interested In?
                Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee that the pet you’ve inquired about will still be
                available. For more information regarding the status of your inquiry, or the pet you’ve applied for,
                please contact the shelter or rescue group that listed the pet. The shelter’s address and contact
                information can also be found on the pet’s profile page.</li>
            <li>Do I Need to Apply to fluffytails?
                No. Once you’ve submitted an inquiry to an adoption group, the shelter or rescue group with the pet
                you’re interested in will be sent your information. It is then up to the shelter or rescue group to
                determine whether it’s a match.</li>
            <li>How Will I Know If I’ve Been Approved to Adopt a Pet?
                After submitting an adoption inquiry, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will
                contact you. You may also reach out to the shelter or rescue group directly to follow up</li>
            <li>How Long Will It Take to Hear Back from the Adoption Group?
                Petfinder is a community and, like all communities, each individual or organization is a little bit
                different. Some days you might send in an inquiry and get a response within a few minutes and other
                groups may take a few days or a week. Don’t be afraid to follow up with the shelter or rescue group</li>

        <div class="div"><h2>How Can I Adopt a Pet I See On Petfinder?</h2></div>
        <p>Petfinder is a website and searchable database for nearly 14,000 animal shelters and rescue groups across the
            US, Canada and Mexico to post their adoptable pets. While Petfinder does provide a web-based adoption
            platform for groups across North America, we are not involved in any of our members’ pet adoptions. Each
            adoption group using our site has its own adoption policies and procedures and solely handles its own pet
            adoptions. To adopt a pet you see listed on Petfinder, please click the "Adopt Me" button or the "Contact
            this Organization" button on the pet's profile. You will then be given the group's contact information and,
            if an email is available for that group, you will be able to email that group using our form. More questions
            about adopting a pet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does Contacting the Adoption Group Put The Pet on Hold?
                Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee the pet you’ve applied for, nor does it place a pet
                “on hold”. For more information regarding the status of your application, or the pet you’ve applied for,
                please contact the shelter or rescue group listing the pet directly.</li>
            <li>Does Contacting the Shelter or Rescue Group Reserve the Pet I’m Interested In?
                Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee that the pet you’ve inquired about will still be
                available. For more information regarding the status of your inquiry, or the pet you’ve applied for,
                please contact the shelter or rescue group that listed the pet. The shelter’s address and contact
                information can also be found on the pet’s profile page.</li>
            <li>Am I Applying to Petfinder?
                No. Once you’ve submitted an inquiry to an adoption group, the shelter or rescue group with the pet
                you’re interested in will be sent your information. It is then up to the shelter or rescue group to
                determine whether it’s a match</li>
            <li>How Will I Know If I've Been Approved to Adopt a Pet?
                After submitting an adoption inquiry, the shelter or rescue group with the pet you’re interested in will
                contact you. You may also reach out to the shelter or rescue group directly to follow up.</li>
            <li>How Long Will It Take to Hear Back From The Adoption Group?
                Petfinder is a community and, like all communities, each individual or organization is a little bit
                different. Ideally, when you visit an animal shelter someone will greet you when you walk through the
                door, escort you in to meet the pets and answer your questions. Sometimes though, the person at the desk
                is on a tough phone call, everyone in the reception office is tied up with two boxes of kittens that
                just arrived, and the volunteer in the dog kennels just started and has as many questions as you do.
                Likewise, some days you might send in an inquiry and get a response within a few minutes and other
                groups may take a few days or a week. Don’t be afraid to follow up with the shelter or rescue group.

        </ul>
        <div class="o"><h2>What Are The Requirements For Adopting A Pet?</h2></div>
        <p>Each adoption group that lists its pets on Petfinder has its own rules and requirements for adopting pets. If
            you’re interested in a specific pet, please reach out to the adoption group that created the pet listing to
            find out what their policies are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can I Adopt a Pet Who’s Out of State?
                Thank you for your interest in adopting a pet! Each adoption group that lists its pets on Petfinder has
                its own rules and requirements for adopting out pets. Petfinder doesn’t dictate adoption group policy,
                including adoption requirements and whether out-of-state adoptions are allowed by each group. If you’re
                interested in a specific pet, please reach out to the adoption group that has that pet. (You can contact
                the group using the contact information found of the pet’s profile page).</li>
            <li>Does Contacting the Shelter or Rescue Group Reserve the Pet I’m Interested In?
                Submitting an adoption inquiry does not guarantee that the pet you’ve inquired about will still be
                available. For more information regarding the status of your inquiry, or the pet you’ve applied for,
                please contact the shelter or rescue group that listed the pet. The shelter’s address and contact
                information can also be found on the pet’s profile page.</li>
            <li>Will There Be An Adoption Fee?
                Petfinder doesn’t dictate adoption group policy, including adoption requirements and fees. If you’re
                interested in a specific pet, please contact the adoption group that created the pet listing through the
                Pet Profile page or Member Home Page.</li>
            <li>Why Do Shelters and Rescue Groups Charge Adoption Fees?
                Adoption fees help cover the medical care of the animal while he or she waits for a new home, as well as
                food and transportation costs. These fees help to provide care for the other animals in the shelter or
                rescue group who may have medical bills that are much higher than any possible adoption fee. The money
                also acts as a donation to help support the organization as a whole, allowing the group to continue its
                efforts to rescue and rehome pets.</li>

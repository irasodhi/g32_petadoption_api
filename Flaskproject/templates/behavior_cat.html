        <h2>Purring</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Purring is often associated with contentment. Cats typically purr when they’re
                being petted, cuddled, or even when they’re relaxing in a peaceful environment.</li>

            <li>Why it happens: Purring is also used by cats to comfort themselves when they're in pain or feeling
                anxious, so it doesn’t always mean they’re happy.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Meowing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When it happens: Cats meow to communicate with humans.</li>
            <li>
                Why it happens: Unlike some animals, cats don’t meow to communicate with each other as much, but
                they do it with people. They may meow for food, attention, or to greet you. Some cats are more vocal
                than others, and the type of meow can signal different things (hunger, discomfort, or excitement).

        <h2>Hiding or Seeking Solitude</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Cats may retreat to a quiet place or hide under furniture, especially if they’re
                feeling stressed or unwell.</li>
            <li>Why it happens: Cats are creatures of habit, and they seek out safe, secure spaces to rest or escape
                from anything that might be causing anxiety. It’s their way of protecting themselves.</li>

        <h2>Biting or Scratching in Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When it happens: Cats sometimes engage in rough play, involving gentle biting or scratching.</li>
            <li>Why it happens: Playful biting or scratching is often a way for kittens to learn hunting skills, but
                adult cats can also engage in this behavior. If it’s too rough, it’s important to redirect them to
                appropriate toys.

        <h2> Slow Blinking</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Cats blink slowly at you, often while they’re calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Why it happens: This slow blinking is a sign of trust and affection. It's often called a "cat kiss,"
                and cats do it when they feel safe and loved. You can return the gesture by blinking slowly at your
                cat.</li>

        <h2>Chasing Shadows or Lights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Cats are often fascinated by moving shadows, lights, or reflections.</li>
            <li>
                Why it happens: This behavior is tied to their predatory instincts. They see these movements as a
                potential target to chase, even though they’re not real prey.

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2> Pacing or Restlessness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Cats may pace around, meow, or show restlessness.</li>
            <li>Why it happens: This could indicate hunger, a desire for attention, or anxiety. Cats can also become
                restless if they feel bored or overstimulated.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Following You Around</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When it happens: Cats may follow you from room to room or sit near you.</li>
            <li>Why it happens: This is often a sign of affection, as cats enjoy being close to their humans. They
                may also follow you because they’re curious about what you’re doing or hoping for a treat or
                attention.</li>
